**Release Date:** October 2025  
**Version:** 3.2.0  

This release represents months of development focused on creating the most developer-friendly CLI experience possible. We've rebuilt core systems from the ground up with a focus on performance, reliability, and ease of use.

### ⚡ **Revolutionary Development Server**

We've completely reimagined what a development server should be. This isn't just another dev server - it's a comprehensive development environment with enterprise-grade monitoring and analytics.

**🔍 Advanced Monitoring & Analytics:**
- Real-time build performance tracking with detailed metrics
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization suggestions
- CPU performance profiling and bottleneck detection
- Comprehensive hot reload analytics and failure tracking

**📊 Professional Development Dashboard:**
Access the full-featured dashboard at `http://localhost:8001/api/radnt/dashboard` for real-time insights into your development process. Features include live performance metrics, system resource monitoring, and build analytics.

**🚀 Intelligent Hot Reload System:**
Our enhanced hot reload system provides selective module replacement with intelligent failure recovery, significantly reducing development friction and improving productivity.

radnt dev                    # Just run this and watch the magic
radnt dev --port 3000       # If you're picky about ports
radnt dev --kill            # Nuclear option - kills everything first

### 🧩 **Enhanced Component System**

The component system has been completely rebuilt with a focus on reliability, automation, and developer experience. Our new system eliminates common integration issues and provides a seamless component installation experience.

**🎯 Key Features:**
- **Automated Dependency Management**: Intelligent dependency resolution with automatic installation and conflict handling
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Advanced typo correction and component name suggestions
- **Batch Operations**: Support for multiple component installation in a single command

**🎨 Professional Component Library:**
Our curated collection includes production-ready components: buttons, cards, dialogs, forms, tables, notifications, and more. Each component is fully typed, accessible, and follows modern React patterns.

```bash
radnt add button             # The classic
radnt add button card form   # Going ham
radnt add --all             # YOLO mode (adds everything)
radnt add                   # Let me choose, please
```

**⚠️ Manual Steps Required:**
1. **Development Server**: New analytics may require clearing `.next` cache
2. **Components**: Some component props may have changed - check console warnings
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm audit fix` to update security vulnerabilities

**🔧 Configuration Updates:**
```json
// package.json - New scripts (automatically added)
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "radnt dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```
